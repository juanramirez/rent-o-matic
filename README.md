# rent-o-matic 🧾

**rent-o-matic** is a small personal automation project to generate rent invoices using  
**Google Sheets + Google Apps Script**, designed for real-world use by small landlords.

It started as a personal tool and grew into a clean, modular Apps Script project,
now versioned with Git and synced via `clasp`.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Central **billing panel** in Google Sheets
- 🧑‍💼 Tenant management (base rent, identifiers, short names)
- ➕ Extra billable concepts (with or without VAT)
- 🧮 Automatic calculation of:
  - taxable base
  - VAT
  - totals
- 📄 Invoice generation from a **template spreadsheet**
- 🔗 Direct link to the generated invoice
- 🗂 Clean, modular Apps Script codebase

---

## 🧠 Project structure

The codebase is intentionally split by domain:


The original monolithic implementation existed in the early stages of the project
and is preserved in Git history for reference.

## 🚀 How it works (high level)

1. The user selects:
   - tenant
   - month
   - year  
   from a **billing panel** spreadsheet.
2. The script:
   - reads tenant data
   - aggregates extra concepts
   - calculates totals and VAT
3. A new invoice spreadsheet is created from a template.
4. A dialog shows a summary and a direct link to the invoice.
